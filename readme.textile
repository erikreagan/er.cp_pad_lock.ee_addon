h1. CP Pad Lock

This extension was just thrown together for my particular environment and a small need I had. Your mileage may vary.

Enabling this extension locks down the CP to Super Admins only. When a non-Super Admin tries to login or access a CP page they get the following message:

!http://files.droplr.com/files/8009172/UFA5c.Screen%20shot%202010-04-29%20at%2015:12:15.png!

The message is pulled from the <code>system/utilities/offline.html</code> file and tweaked slightly.

I could make it more customizable but this was for an immediate personal need where I had to do some irregular database tweaking in a production environment. I didn't want any entries being updated while I was modifying things. Let me know if you have any requests or suggestions.

h2. Compatibility

* ExpressionEngine 1.6.x only
* Requires the <code>system/utilities/offline.html</code> file be in place (it should be unless you specifically deleted or moved it after install)


h2. Installation

* Copy <code>ext.cp_pad_lock.php</code> to your <code>system/extensions</code> directory
* Enable the extension (if you aren't a Super Admin you will immediately be unable to access the CP)


h2. Change Log

+*April 29, 2010: 1.0.0*+

* Initial Release

h2. To Do Thoughts

* Add a visual indicator in the CP when the Pad Lock is on (reminding the Super Admins(s) to turn it off eventually)
* Allow settings to choose member groups to lock out when enabled (rather that just Super Admins)
* Allow for customization of "Locked out" message/view
