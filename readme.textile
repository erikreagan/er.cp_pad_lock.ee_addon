h1. CP Pad Lock

This extension was just thrown together for my particular environment and a small need I had. Your mileage may vary.

Enabling this extension locks down the CP to Super Admins only. When a non-Super Admin tries to login or access a CP page they get the following message:

*"This site's Control Panel will be offline momentarily while we perform some updates. We apologize for any inconvenience."*

The message is pulled from the <code>system/utilities/offline.html</code> file and tweaked slightly.

I could make it more customizable but this was for an immediate personal need. Let me know if you have any requests or suggestions. Contact "me on twitter":http://twitter.com/erikreagan or via "my website":http://erikreagan.com/contact/.


h2. Compatibility

* ExpressionEngine 1.6.x only
* Requires the <code>system/utilities/offline.html</code> file be in place (it should be unless you specifically deleted or moved it after install)


h2. Installation

* Copy <code>ext.cp_pad_lock.php</code> to your <code>system/extensions</code> directory
* Enable the extension (if you aren't a Super Admin you will immediately be unable to access the CP)
